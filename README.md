## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foodbridge.git
cd foodbridge
```

2. Install frontend dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

4. Create a .env file in the server directory with the following variables:
```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
```

5. Start the development servers

Frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

Backend:
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

The frontend reads its backend URL from `REACT_APP_API_URL`. For local development,
`.env.local` should contain:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

For a deployed frontend, set `REACT_APP_API_URL` in the hosting provider's environment
variables, for example:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://hack-odisha.onrender.com/api
```
